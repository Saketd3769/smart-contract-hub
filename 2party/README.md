### IN this I have implemneted 2 Round voting system.
The two-round system (also known as the second ballot, runoff voting or ballotage) is a voting method used to elect a single candidate, where voters cast a single vote for their preferred candidate. The election proceeds to a second round only if in the first round no candidate has received a simple majority (more than 50%) of votes cast, or at least some other prescribed percentage. In the second round, usually only the two candidates who received the most votes in the first round, or those candidates who received above a prescribed proportion of the votes, would be candidates in the second round. Any remaining candidate is free to withdraw from the second round. 

**This is similar to FPTP but here there is change in checking the winner. First its checked if a candidate has gained more then half votes then he directly wins. If not then We find the 2 best candidates and the voters vote again between these 2 candidates. Now the cnadidates with more votes wins**
